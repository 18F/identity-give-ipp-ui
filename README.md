The most up-to-date information about the CI/CD flows for this repo can be

### Pre-requisites
- Node.js [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
- React Router `npm install react-router-dom`

### Getting started
1. Enter `npm install` into the console, this will install the node_modules.
2. Enter `npm start` into the console, this will start the app on port 3000 in
your browser.

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React
in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)
for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have
full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but
they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for
small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this
feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you
couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
