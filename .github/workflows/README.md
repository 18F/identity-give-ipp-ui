# GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows

## Deploy Dev
The deploy-dev workflow will deploy the project to the GIVE dev environment within Cloud.gov

## Stale Items
The stale-items workflow will run once per day and mark issues and PR's as stale if they have not seen any activity over the last 30 days. After being marked stale for 5 days, the workflow will close the item.
